                            This project analyzed the historical data during a plague focusing on importance of Hand Washing. At such time Hand washing was not though of as significant even by doctors. One doctor used statistics to persuade their colleagues but no one listened due to less visual power at that time to communicated findings through data analysis. In this project same study is done but the findings are communicated with visuals to make it understandable to general audiences.

While it is easy for us to realize their equivalence, basic programming commands will fail to equate such two strings.

                        <h3>Predicting Credit Card Aproval</h3>
                        <p>
                           Banks get a lot of credit card application in daily basis. In order to maintain a good default ratio, the banks need to determine which applicants might default their credit. This project uses Machine learning to determine on the past data of applicants in order to determine if the credit card is to be approved or not.

                        <p>
                            Is it possible for a machine to differentiate between honeybees and bumblebees? Despite their distinct behaviors and appearances, the task can be challenging for machines due to variations in backgrounds, positions, and image resolutions. However, the ability to identify bee species from images would greatly benefit researchers by enabling them to collect field data more efficiently. Pollinating bees play crucial roles in ecology and agriculture, and their populations are threatened by diseases like colony collapse disorder. Accurate identification of different bee species in the wild would enhance our understanding of their prevalence and growth, aiding in conservation efforts for these important insects.
